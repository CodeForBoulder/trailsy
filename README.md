Trailsy
=======

This version of Trailsy is a Code for Boulder project that uses [OuterSpatial](http://outerspatial.com) API calls to retrieve OpenTrails data. It has been forked from the original Code for America 2013 Trailsy project found [here](https://github.com/codeforamerica/trailsy).

## Setup
This project depends on Node.js (for dependency management, the build step, and a dev server), which we will assume you've installed either from a binary [here](https://nodejs.org/download/) or using your favorite package manager.

After cloning this repo and moving to the repo directory at the command line, running `npm install` will install remaining dependencies (local to this project), after which `npm start` will launch a dev server that serves the app at `http://localhost:8080`.

Since the conversion to using OpenTrails is a WIP, expect some functionality to be missing.

## Contributing
In the spirit of [free software][free-sw], **everyone** is encouraged to help
improve this project.
